# Restaurant Page 🍽️

This is a simple restaurant homepage. It dynamically renders most <br> of its contents (images, text, slides) using JavaScript. It was an assignment from <br>
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page#assignment">The Odin Project Curriculum</a>. See demo <a href="https://ivantbv.github.io/restaurant-page/">here</a>

# User Interface and concept 🖥️

This is a single page website that uses tabbed browsing access to <br> show off the contents. 3 main tabs - Home, Menu and Contacts. <br> I made seperate files for each tab and exported them to index.js which is responsible for <br> the tabs switching logic. <br>
<strong>Home</strong> tab loads on page load and displays a welcoming text and the restaurant's logo. <br>
<strong>Menu</strong> tab opens 3 sub-tabs with "Main Dishes", "Desserts" and "Drinks" that are placed in a <br> carousel which displays images of the dishes and their names on top. I used the library <a href="https://glidejs.com/">Glidejs</a> for the carousel. <br>
<strong>Contacts</strong> tab opens the "location" of the restaurant with <br> a google map. I used 'iframe' tag in the HTML to embed the map. <br>

# Learning outcomes 🧑‍🎓

I practiced for the first time npm, webpack and ES6 modules.
